        <p> This is the log of my progress in this project, where I listed the steps that leads to the completion of
            this project <br><br>
            The idea of this project is suggested by Dr.Dobson. As a relatively new teacher in the Harley School, he
            realized that one of the difficulty for those new to Harley is recognizing the different names/symbols of a
            room, as one room can be refered to in different names including a conbination of letters and numbers <br><br>
            Therefore, we decided to make an interactive map, where its primary function is to represent and
            visualize Harley in a Google map, and a location can be searched and located with various different tags,
            including associated displine, teacher, function, etc.<br><br>
            To develop a map embedded in a website, a level of understanding of the three website developing languages
            (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) is neccessary. I started to learn and progress through the three language with
            W3Schools and making an simple Testing site. </p>
